{{!-- The *user* page and *user profile* page has been replaced with only the `account page`. So accountpage.handlebars is only page rendered after successful login attempt, and @Kristen De La Rosa  mentioned it will look very similar to the main Home Page.

Only a few differences like allowing the User to see their Username on the page to let them know they successfully are logged in.

The Post Button on accountpage.handlebars also, will actually lead to a Create Post page (I am working on) by a `href="/accountpage"` --}}
